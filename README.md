# Hopfury

**Hopfury** is a 2D mobile platformer where you jump over platforms and enemies, shoot fireballs to defeat enemys (with cooldown), and enjoy the unique beats of each level. Simple controls, satisfying action, and a simple and clean design make it both fun and engaging.

- Swipe up to **launch fireballs** with a cooldown
