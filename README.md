## Research Purpose

This game was developed as part of a **Master’s thesis** focused on **Game Interaction Primitives**. It records player interactions, including:

- All **screen taps**
- The **obstacles encountered**
- Level metadata and event timestamps
- Both a **JSON file** and a **gamelog file** are generated and saved locally on the mobile device

These logs are later analyzed to study patterns in player behavior and consistency across different games and play styles.

## Assets

All used assets (sounds, music, sprites, etc.) are **free-to-use**.

## Built With

- Unity (2D)
- C#
- Targeted for Android (mobile)
