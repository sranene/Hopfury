# Hopfury

**Hopfury** is a 2D mobile platformer where you jump over platforms and enemies, shoot fireballs to defeat foes (with cooldown), and enjoy the unique beats of each level. Simple controls, satisfying action, and a retro aesthetic make it both fun and engaging.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Tap to **jump** over obstacles and enemies
- Swipe up to **launch fireballs** with a cooldown
- Avoid obstacles, defeat enemies, and reach the end of each level

## 📊 Research Purpose

This game was developed as part of a **Master’s thesis** focused on **Game Interaction Primitives**. It records player interactions, including:

- All **screen taps**
- The **obstacles encountered**
- Level metadata and event timestamps
- Both a **JSON file** and a **gamelog file** are generated and saved locally on the mobile device

These logs are later analyzed to study patterns in player behavior and consistency across different games and play styles.
